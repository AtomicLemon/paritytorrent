Parity Blockchain Torrent

Hi guys, I have a fully synced node on parity 2.7.2-stable and I've decided to upload the entire ethereum db.

Note: 
* I'm pretty sure it will only work with parity 2.7.2
* Even though I haven't tampered with the blockchain at all, I highly recommend just syncing yourself
* The sync finishes at around block 9997000
* The total size is 186GB (Compressed)
* If you cannot find any peers, try adding these trackers: `udp://9.rarbg.com:2710/announce` or `udp://5.206.13.166:6969/announce`
